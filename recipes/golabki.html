  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Golabki are cabbage leaves stuffed with ground beef and rice, then simmered in tomato soup.</p>
  <p>They're good with mashed potatoes and a cucumber and sour cream salad.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 head cabbage, cored</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups cooked rice</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>3 (10.5 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
    <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans tomato juice, or more to taste</li>
    <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</p>
      <p>Place cabbage head into the pot, cover, and cook until leaves are softened enough to remove from the head,
        about <strong>3 minutes</strong>.</p>
      <p>Remove cabbage from the pot and let sit until leaves are cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Remove 18 whole leaves from the cabbage head, cutting out any thick tough center ribs.</p>
      <p>Set whole leaves aside.</p>
      <p>Chop the remaining cabbage and spread it in the bottom of a casserole dish.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</p>
      <p>Add onion and sauté until tender, <strong>5 to 10 minutes</strong>.</p>
      <p>Remove from the heat and let cool, about <strong>5 minutes</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Combine beef, pork, cooked rice, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</p>
      <p>Add onion and mix until well combined.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Preheat the oven to <strong>350 degrees F</strong> (<strong>175 degrees C</strong>).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Place about 1/2 cup beef mixture onto a cabbage leaf.</p>
      <p>Roll the leaf around beef mixture, tucking in the sides to create an envelope around the meat.</p>
      <p>Repeat to make remaining cabbage rolls.</p>
      <p>Place cabbage rolls in a layer over chopped cabbage in the casserole dish.</p>
      <p>Season with salt and pepper.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Whisk condensed soup, tomato juice, and ketchup together in a bowl; pour over cabbage rolls and cover the dish
        tightly with aluminum foil.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cabbage is tender and meat is cooked through, about 1 hour.</p>
      <p>Uncover for the last <strong>20 to 30 minutes</strong> of cooking.</p>
      <p>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <strong>160 degrees F</strong>
        (<strong>70 degrees C</strong>).</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
